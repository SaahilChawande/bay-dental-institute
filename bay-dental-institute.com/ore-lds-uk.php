Similarly many candidates take up PHD positions, studies in universities in a bid to move. The decision is yours. We have started this center to help candidates avoid taking unnecessary career risks.</p>

A lot of individuals providing guidance overseas are doing so part time from their homes, over skype, whatsapp etc. While we do not question the quality of the guidance, we are a proper center providing a full time set up and guidance to candidates who do not wish to travel to the UK for guidance / training. Having gone through the entire process ourselves we have a clear understanding of what is required to pass this exam.  We have extensive knowledge of the weakness of different candidates and how to overcome them. We wish to train you of the mistakes you will make on the day of the exam, and to not make them. Also our center is based in India, it is also more affordable to take the training here as opposed to travelling to the UK for the exam training. </p>
